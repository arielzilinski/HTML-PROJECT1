        Reptiles are air-breathing vertebrates covered in special skin made up of scales, bony plates, or a combination of both. <br>
        They include crocodiles, snakes, lizards, turtles, and tortoises.<br>
        Because of their slow metabolism and heat-seeking behavior, reptiles are cold-blooded.<br>
        The one in the picture is a cobra.<br>
