        A fish is an animal which lives and breathes in water. <br>
        All fish are vertebrates (have a backbone) and most breathe through gills and have fins and scales.<br>
        Fish make up about half of all known vertebrate species. <br>
        Fish have been on the earth for more than 500 million years.<br>
        The on in the picture is a goldfish.<br>
