        Amphibians are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive. <br>
        The species in this group include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. <br>
        All can breathe and absorb water through their very thin skin.<br>
         Amphibians also have special skin glands that produce useful proteins.<br>
         The one in the picture is a frog.<br>
