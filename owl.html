        Birds' bodies are covered with a light, tough layer of feathers and they have very light skeletons.<br>
         Instead of teeth, they have hornlike beaks, or bills.<br>
          Birds hatch from eggs, and many species build nests where their eggs and young can develop in safety.<br>
          The one in the picture is an owl.<br>
